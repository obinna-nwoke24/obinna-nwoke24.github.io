                My name is Obinna Jason Nwoke II and I am a seccond year student at St. John's University
                <br>
                <br>
                I started coding because I was always in love with video games as a kid, then as I got 
                older, I realized that I wanted to figure out how those games were coded. The first computer 
                language that I attempted to learn was Python. It was hard for me, so I gave up. When I 
                graduated highschool and went to St. John's University, they introduced me to Java.<br><br> My 
                first semester learning Java was very tough, but I slowly started to get a firm grip on it. 
                By the end of my first year, I was writing code in Java to run practice projects just to 
                see if I have control over what I am coding. I was creating really personal codes, like 
                a game library, practice recursive methods, etc. Coming to the middle of my second semester 
                (at the time of the creation of this page), I realized that I needed to get more than just 
                Java under my belt.<br><br> So I used 
                <em><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a></em> to learn my second 
                language (which was my first attempt), Python. While learning Python, I realized that it 
                was quick to pick back up for me since I have the coding experience with Java. Once I 
                completed the course for <em>Learn Python 2</em>, I ran a school district project that helped 
                me grasp more of an idea on Python. Then that is when I decided I needed a portfolio for my 
                source codes. A little bit of research, and I come across Github pages. That is when I decided to 
                learn HTML and CSS, in that order, to create my own person website portfolio to showcase what 
                I know.
